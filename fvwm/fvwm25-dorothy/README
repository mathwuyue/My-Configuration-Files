Notes by Migo: I have patched the configuration so that you may install it
to any place. For example, unpack fvwm-dorothy.tar.gz to you home directory
and then execute:

  Restart fvwm2 -f ~/fvwm-dorothy/rc.fvwm

I also fixed some small glitches in window buttons.
Here are the original notes, but they are not really needed now:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install this directory as ~/.fvwm.  Link rc.fvwm to .fvwm2rc as follows:

ln -s rc.fvwm .fvwm2rc

This makes it easier to grep the configuration files, and also prevents
me from over-writing your .fvwm2rc when you install, which might make
you very angry.
